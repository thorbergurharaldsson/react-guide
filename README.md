# My first React app

This project is my first react app, I had a lot of fun making it I will for sure use react in some future projects, I think I might also look into some other frameworks like angular and vue, I also dipped my toe in to react native and that seems like a lot of fun!

I created this project using an [api for currency in relation to ISK](http://docs.apis.is/#endpoint-currency) and an [api for creating QR codes](https://www.qrtag.net/api/)

## What I like about React

- React makes the code alot cleaner then using Vanilla JS
- The components are really nice to break up the code into sections
  - The reusability of components is also a huge plus
- It's really simple to create a SPA using react, the routing is a lot easier then creating it with Vanilla JS
